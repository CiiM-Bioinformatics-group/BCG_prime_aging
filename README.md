# BCG_prime_aging project
In this project, we reported the relationship between circulating inflammatory proteome and epigenetic age acceleration as assessed by DNA methylation across four independent cohorts representing different age groups and health conditions. Furthermore, we explored the associations between aging and immune dysregulation, frailty, and the presence of multimorbidity. 

In this repository, we upload the processed data and code for generating the main figures. The summary of the figures is as follows: 

In Figure 1, we showed the associations between biological age(DNAmAge) and chronological age.

In Figure 2, we mainly showed the relationships between age-related phenotypes and clinical phenotypes (multimorbidity and frailty index).

In Figure 3, we presented the relationships between inflammatory proteins and age-related phenotypes. 

In Figure 4, we presented the causal results performed with two sample MR and demonstrated the proteins related to multimorbidity.

In figure 5, we presented the sex stratified analysis between age related phenotypes and proteins.

In Figure 6, we showed how age-related phenotypes were associated with immune responsiveness.
